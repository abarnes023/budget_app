# budget_app
This budget application was built as a final project for Harvard's CS50 edX course.

The application allows users to register for an account, login, and enter budgeting data for each month.

The articles page parses through the feed of Get Rich Slowly (www.getrichslowly.org/blog/) and displays the latest article headlines.
