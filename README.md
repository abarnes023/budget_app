# budget_app
This budget application was built as a final project for Harvard's CS50 edX course.

The application allows users to register for an account, login/ logout, and enter budgeting data for each month. The account usernames and passwords and the budgeting data for each month are stored in a SQL database.

On the budget page the application will calculate if a user is spending an appropriate amount on rent and saving enough based on the income.

The articles page parses through the feed of Get Rich Slowly (www.getrichslowly.org/blog/) and displays the latest article headlines for users to easily access tips on finances and budgeting.

The languages and libraries used in this project include:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Flask

*Please note that some of the code written here may not run correctly outside of the Harvard edX IDE.*
